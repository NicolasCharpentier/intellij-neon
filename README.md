# Neon in IntelliJ IDEA / PhpStorm

**Current status: stable, basic functions**

[Neon](http://ne-on.org/) is a YAML-like language useful for configuration. It is part of [Nette framework](http://nette.org)
 and it's very nice! You should definitely use it.

This plugin aims to add supports for this language into PhpStorm (or the whole IntelliJ platform).

## Features
* lexer, parser (internal)
* syntax highlighting
* comment/uncomment
* bracket / parenthesis matching
* code completion
* go to class
* ... more to come


## Install

1. Go to File â†’ Settings in PhpStorm
2. Select *Plugins* on the left
3. Click *Browse Repositories* button on the bottom
4. Find *NEON support* and install it
5. Optional: Install also *Nette framework helpers* plugin ;)


If you prefer your own build from *master*, open this project in *IntelliJ IDEA* as a *Plugin project*, go to *Build* -> *Prepare for deployment* and install it in your PhpStorm.


## Development

Please tell me what **features** you'd like in *Issues tab*.
